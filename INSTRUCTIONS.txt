Hello, 

Thank you for purchasing one of our USB Encrypted IOTA Wallets. This USB will contain several security features to make sure this information is kept only for you. This USB is encrypted and the password for it is your name!

Password:PersonName

Please be sure to write this somewhere safe and secure. 

You will need to follow a couple steps for you to create a secure wallet seed where no one not even iMarkett Co. will have access to this.

1. Create a secure seed
By clicking the "Generate Seed" application a "seed.txt" file will be created within the USB. This file will contain your seed which gives you access to your secure IOTA wallet.

2. IOTA Wallet
To open the wallet click the "IOTA Wallet" application that is inside the USB. You will be asked what type of node you want to run. Choose the light node and choose the following host:

Host: http://iotanode.party:14265

If it doesn't appear on the list then select custom and paste the link that is above. 

Periodically, the network upgrades. If you are trying to send a transaction and it doesn't go through change your node in the Tools->Edit Node Configuration to one that appears on https://iota.dance/nodes

If your transaction remains pending in the History section be sure to Reattach or Promote it! 

3. Claiming your IOTA.

If you purchased IOTA through us you will be given a file named "purchasedIOTA.txt" it will contain the Private seed that contains the IOTA you purchased. Send your IOTA from the seed that is in "purchasedIOTA.txt" and send it to your seed that is in "seed.txt". 

A more detailed way in to use the IOTA wallet can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVa_riFqprw
